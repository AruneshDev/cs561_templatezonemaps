# CS 561: Data Systems Architecture - TemplateZonemaps


## About

TemplateZonemaps is a simple template for you, the student, to use for the simple
implementation project in CS 561. Note that this is a high level template, it is
not extensive, rather it is meant to help guide you on what we expect when
you implement the zonemaps. You can use this as base code or start from
scratch. You may require additional helper functions to satisfy the requirements of the project.
